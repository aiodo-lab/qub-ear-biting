# Detect and track ear-biting in pigs.

The experiments tested two state-of-the-art detection networks namely YOLOv4-CSP and YOLOv7. Both models are based on Pytorch Libraries and are available in the referenced links.

We also used DEEPSORT for tracking.

To run this code, you need the following:

Requirements: imutils 0.5.4, numpy 1.19.5, opencv	4.5.1
