# Detection and tracking of ear-biting in pigs.

In this experiment, we trained two state-of-the-art detection models namely YOLOv4-CSP and YOLOv7 to localise regions in images with ear biting. Essentially, we describe ear biting as a contact between the ear of one pig and the snout of another. The detection models used are based on Pytorch Libraries and are available in the links below. We used DeepSORT for tracking.
